    - DoubleClick
    - EnableCAT
    - TagEvent
    - OSDPDName
    - DefaultEvent
    - PreEventLength

    â†’ enhanced my understanding of the parameters needed when writing test code

# February
- Reviewed all the functions in the libraries
- Updated outdated code
- Fixed any errors that occurred
- Removed redundant functions
- Added new necessary functions
    - lib_bwc.py
    - lib_bwc_user.py
    - lib_bwc_rootdir.py
    - lib_gen.py

- Feb 21 : Got access to Github  
â†’ Merged them into the develop branch

# March
- Developed new functions in the library
    - log_metadata_parser
    - get_inf_from_metadata : A function that extracts specific information from all metadata files in all subfolders within DCIM

# April
- Added consistent docstrings for all the library and test functions
- Added Python parameter hints
- Wrote Unit Test code
    - test_BWC_fw_flash.py
    - test_BWC_EnableCAT.py

- Converted Unit Test â†’ Pytest
    - test_BWC_fw_flash.py
    - test_BWC_EnableCAT.py
    - test_BWC_tag.py

# May
- Wrote More Pytests
    - test_BWC_tag.py
    - test_BWC_bookmark.py
    - test_BWC_multi_rec.py

- lib_gen.py : init_camera
    - Automatically place the necessary files (config.ini / config.json + related files) in the root folder to set up the test environment before starting the test

        â†’ Enabled more flexible use of the pytest framework

# June
- Wrote More Pytests
    - test_BWC_multi_rec.py
    - test_BWC_hash.py
    - test_BWC_snapshot.py
    - test_BWC_encryption.py
    - test_BWC_video.py

- Used parametrize

# July
- Created a test file template
    - Test file contains 2 types of functions  
    â†’ To reuse the repetitive verifications for each new test  
    â†’ To create new tests more efficiently with a framework

        1. test_*** : function used to execute the actual tests
            - 8 predefined steps
                1. BWC dock and mount
                2. Initialize BWC with given parameters
                3. Generate an expected_dict (#2)
                4. Undock BWC
                5. Trigger the test
                6. BWC dock and mount
                7. Verifications
                8. Undock BWC

                â†’ These 8 steps are applied uniformly to all tests and do not require any special modifications

        2. get_expected_dict : a helper function to create expected_dict
            - By changing the elements of the `expected_dict` for each test, the corresponding verification is executed
            - As verification progresses, elements used for future verifications are added to the dictionary

- Created a new file : lib_bwc_verifications.py
    - Contains all the verification functions
    - Main function : verification_test(expected_dict: dict) â†’ bool
        - Checks the elements of the expected_dict and executes the corresponding functions

- Finished modifying test files to align with the new template
    - test_BWC_multi_rec.py
    - test_BWC_snapshot.py
    - test_BWC_hash.py
    - test_BWC_tag.py
    - test_BWC_bookmark.py

# August
- Modified the remaining test functions that have not yet been aligned with the new template
    - test_BWC_fw_flash.py
    - test_BWC_EnableCAT.py
    - test_BWC_encryption.py

- Merged all the created pull requests into the develop branch
- Ensured that all the written tests are working correctly without any errors

# Co-op Experience Summary
- Learning to write unit tests and use pytest within a framework 

    â†’ a valuable opportunity to enhance my Python skills and deepen my understanding of Git
- Reflecting on my journey

    â†’ proud to see how BWC has gradually become more integrated into the test framework
- Starting new tasks before merging previous PRs presented challenges, leading to conflicts

    â†’ studying Git flow made it easier to resolve these issues
- Truly grateful and lucky for having this opportunity to gain valuable work experience and for the support provided to successfully complete my tasks ðŸ˜Š
