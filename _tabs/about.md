## About Me

Hello! I'm **Jooyoung (Julia) Lee**, a passionate Computing Science student at Simon Fraser University, set to graduate in May 2025. Originally from Korea, I moved to Vancouver, Canada after graduating high school to pursue my passion for Computer Science. I thrive in new environments and love challenging myself to adapt, learn, and grow in diverse situations. I also enjoy learning step by step, taking the time to understand the details and continuously improve my skills.

I’ve had hands-on experience working as an Automation Tester at **SafeFleet**, where I helped streamline testing processes by implementing Pytest frameworks and designing standardized test templates. Currently, I’m also working as a Math Tutor, helping students from various backgrounds grasp complex concepts in mathematics, encouraging problem-solving, and building their confidence.

Outside of my academic and professional life, I enjoy playing the piano, baking, and photography. I’m always eager to take on new challenges and find innovative solutions, while embracing the process of learning and growing one step at a time. Personally, I strive to be a calm, bright, positive, and polite individual, always mindful of treating others with respect.

Thanks for visiting my page, and feel free to connect with me!
